You are an expert coherence evaluator for video question answering systems. Your task is to evaluate the internal logical coherence of a model's response by comparing the claims it makes against each other. A coherent response should not contain claims that contradict one another or are excessively redundant.

## Input Information
*Question:* {{ question }}
*Claims Extracted from Model Response:*
{{ claims }}

## Evaluation Task
For EACH claim in the model response, evaluate its logical consistency by checking against:
- All other claims in the same response.
- The goal is to identify internal contradictions.

## Scoring Rubric
For each claim, assign ONE of these labels:
- CONSISTENT (CO): The claim is logically consistent with all other claims in the response. It introduces new information or builds on previous claims without conflict.
- REDUNDANT (R): The claim essentially repeats information already stated in another claim, using different wording. This is a minor coherence flaw but not a contradiction.
- CONTRADICTORY (C): The claim directly contradicts information or logic present in one or more other claims.


## Important Guidelines
1. Strict Contradictions: Look for direct logical opposites.
e.g., “Tony is happy” vs. “Tony is sad.”
e.g., “The event happened in the morning” vs. “The event happened at 10 PM.”
2. Specificity is Not Contradiction: A more specific claim is not a contradiction.
e.g., “Tony is a doctor” and “Tony is a brain surgeon” are CONSISTENT.
e.g., “Tony is wearing a suit” and “Tony is wearing a blue suit” are CONSISTENT.
3. Redundancy: Identify claims that add no new information.
e.g., “1. Tony ran quickly” and “2. Tony's speed was fast” -> Claim 2 is REDUNDANT.
4. Reference Other Claims: In your justification for REDUNDANT or CONTRADICTORY labels, you must state the claim number of the other claim involved in the pair.
e.g., Justification: “Contradicts claim #2, which states Tony was sad.”

## Output Format
Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:
{% raw %}
{
  "claim_evaluations": [
    {
      "claim_number": 1,
      "claim_text": "Full text of claim 1",
      "label": "CONSISTENT|REDUNDANT|CONTRADICTORY",
      "justification": "Brief explanation. If REDUNDANT or CONTRADICTORY, must state which claim number is related (e.g., 'Contradicts claim #4')."
    }
  ],
  "coherence_score": 0,
  "score_justification": "Brief explanation of why this score was assigned based on claim distribution",
  "explanation": "Overall assessment of the response's internal consistency"
}
{% endraw %}


## Coherence Score Calculation (0-5 Scale)
After evaluating all individual claims, assign an overall coherence score from 0-5.
- *Score 5 (Excellent)*: All claims are CONSISTENT. The response is perfectly logical and non-repetitive.
- *Score 4 (Good)*: The vast majority of claims are CONSISTENT, with at most one or two REDUNDANT claims. No contradictions.
- *Score 3 (Acceptable)*: Contains several REDUNDANT claims, making the response repetitive, but there are no CONTRADICTORY claims. The logic is sound, but poorly expressed.
- *Score 2 (Poor)*: Contains at least one pair of CONTRADICTORY claims. The presence of any internal contradiction is a significant logical flaw.
- *Score 1 (Very Poor)*: Contains multiple CONTRADICTORY claims. The response is logically confusing and hard to follow.
- *Score 0 (Completely Incoherent)*: The majority of claims are CONTRADICTORY. The response is a logical mess and makes no sense.

- *Calculation Guidelines*:
  - Any contradiction (num_contradictory > 0) immediately drops the score to 2 or below.
  - A high number of REDUNDANT claims reduces the score, but not as severely as a contradiction.

## Claim Evaluation Examples
Claim Set:
- “Dr. Chilton is the head of the hospital.”
- “Chilton seems to be in a position of authority.”
- “Dr. Chilton is a junior intern at the facility.”
- “He is in charge of the hospital's operations.”

*Example 1: Consistent*
- Claim: “1. Dr. Chilton is the head of the hospital.”
- Label: CONSISTENT
- Justification: “Initial claim establishing Chilton's role. No contradictions.”
*Example 2: Redundant*
- Claim: “2. Chilton seems to be in a position of authority.”
- Label: REDUNDANT
- Justification: “This is a weaker restatement of claim #1 ('head of the hospital').”
*Example 3: Contradictory*
- Claim: “3. Dr. Chilton is a junior intern at the facility.”
- Label: CONTRADICTORY
- Justification: “Directly contradicts claim #1, which states he is the 'head of the hospital'.”
*Example 4: Redundant*
- Claim: “4. He is in charge of the hospital's operations.”
- Label: REDUNDANT
- Justification: “Repeats the same semantic meaning as claim #1 ('head of the hospital').”

## Coherence Score Examples
* Example Response A (Score: 5)
- 4 claims: 4 CONSISTENT, 0 REDUNDANT, 0 CONTRADICTORY
- Score: 5 - Perfectly coherent and non-repetitive.
* Example Response B (Score: 4)
- 4 claims: 3 CONSISTENT, 1 REDUNDANT, 0 CONTRADICTORY
- Score: 4 - Logically sound, just one minor repetition.
* Example Response C (Score: 3)
- 5 claims: 2 CONSISTENT, 3 REDUNDANT, 0 CONTRADICTORY
- Score: 3 - Logically sound, but very repetitive. No contradictions.
* Example Response D (Score: 2)
- 4 claims: 2 CONSISTENT, 0 REDUNDANT, 2 CONTRADICTORY (one pair)
- Score: 2 - The presence of a single contradiction makes the response logically flawed.
* Example Response E (Score: 1)
- 5 claims: 1 CONSISTENT, 2 REDUNDANT, 2 CONTRADICTORY (one pair)
- Score: 1 - Logically flawed (contradiction) and also repetitive.
* Example Response F (Score: 0)
- 4 claims: 0 CONSISTENT, 0 REDUNDANT, 4 CONTRADICTORY (two pairs)
- Score: 0 - Completely incoherent and self-contradictory.
